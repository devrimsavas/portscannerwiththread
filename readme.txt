It's a simple yet powerful tool designed to assist network enthusiasts and professionals alike. By leveraging the efficiency of threading, this program efficiently scans a range of IP addresses to identify open ports and offers the ability to ping specific IP addresses to gauge their responsiveness.

program aims to:

Port Scanning: Swiftly scan a given range of IP addresses and pinpoint which ports are open, facilitating the identification of potential vulnerabilities or services running on those addresses.
Pinging: Provide insights into the responsiveness of an IP address. By sending a small packet of information and waiting for a reply, the tool can determine if the address is active and responsive.
Domain Resolution: As an added feature, the tool can also resolve domain names into their corresponding IP addresses, bridging the gap between human-readable domain names and machine-understandable IP addresses.
Designed with a user-friendly interface, this tool is perfect for both beginners looking to delve into the world of networking and seasoned professionals seeking a quick and efficient utility for their tasks.
